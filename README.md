# Naviotech_Project3_Breast_Cancer_Predictor_Dataset_Analysis_Project
 
 This project is based on the Breast Cancer Prediction  Dataset Analysis and Streamlit UI Frontend.  
Here, the prediction whether the tumor is Benign (Non cancerous) or malignant (Cancerous) is made on the basis of the Breast Cancer Dataset imported from scikit library. 

The Machine Learning Algorithm used here is the random Forest Classification Algorithm which makes the decisions and take predictions based on the Decision Trees.  

The predictions are made on features based on : 
 1. Mean of measurements like the mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, mean smoothness, mean compactness, mean concavity, mean concave points and mean symmetry. 
 2. The Standard Error variations shows like the radius_error, texture_error, perimeter_error, area_error, smoothness_error etc.

I've also made various plots for easy visualization of the dataset analysis including the : 
  1. Histogram
  2. Confusion Matrix

## The model Accuracy Score : 96.94%
